Title: Find times when students are available
Version: 0.1-0
Description: Having separately queried the students' schedules from the courses in which they are enrolled,
  the functionality here creates a matrix and plot of 30 minute intervals during the day
  and the number of students who are not in class/discussion/lab at that time.
  From this, we can determine the times when the largest number of students are available.
  We get the students' schedule by querying SISR using SISRTools.
